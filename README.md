# Todo-app

A simple todo app that saves your list of task you need to do.

## Intro

Build an app that simply takes a task and save it in a database.

## Requirement
### User storyboard

- I should be able to add a title.
- I should be able to add one or more items to my list.
- [Optional] Should add due date to the task.
- After I'm done making a task, save it and display that task along with any other list in order.

## Suggestions

You can look into `knex` for the database, `express` for the backend and use [rendering engin](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html) to display the UI. For this project, you can follow the MVC design pattern. I will add anything else if I think of something.
